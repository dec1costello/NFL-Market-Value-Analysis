# 📊 NFL Cap Evolution 

### 🎯 Why % of Cap Matters
As the NFL salary cap grows (~7% annually), nominal contract values become misleading. A $20M deal in 2024 represents 7.8% of cap, while that same $20M in 2030 would represent just 5.2% of cap—a 33% decrease in real value. Our model always evaluates contracts as percentage of cap to enable accurate cross-era comparisons and future projections.

**Projected at 7% annual cap growth*

---
The NFL's positional economy has undergone a radical transformation. While the salary cap has grown 187% ($133M → $382M), **how teams allocate that cap** has shifted even more dramatically. Certain positions have become premium assets, while others have been devalued by analytics and scheme evolution.
